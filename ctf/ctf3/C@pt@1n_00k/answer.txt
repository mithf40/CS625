I ran exploit.py which brute-forces all possible passwords and thus I got the password which is '196412'. After logging in, there were some random images. So, I checked the cookies and changed user to admin. Also, I changed the value of session field to (ee10c315eba2c75b403ea99136f5b48d) md5 hash of 'nimda' which is admin in reverse order. After reloading the page, admin page opens up, which asks a security question. I entered 'alphonso' as its response. After that a page opens which contains hidden text. So, I used an online whitespace2javascript tool to figure out the text. It contains the flag, which is 'cs628a{199a3712ee26ce4eb7d2e57a048df4d3}'.
