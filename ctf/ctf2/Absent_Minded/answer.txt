The program first checks if the environment variable whose name is the content of environment variable named "mithlesh"  is not null. So, I exported some garbage value to "mithlesh". After that, it calls system using the contents in the environment variable named "HACK". So, I exported "more flag.txt" in the "HACK" environment variable. Executing the program after these two exports prints the flag which is "cs628a{673d1ae4d1643d4658978879d0a4b7a3}".
