In '_strncpy', we can overflow the buffer by one byte. Using gdb I found out the address of 'read_flag' and it was '0x080485ad'. Using objdump, I found the address of '_exit' and it was '0x0804a010'. When I debugged the program line by line, I found that size of 'buf' is 208 bytes. In 'crows' function, I tried to give argument such thhat it overflows and writes the address of '_exit' in 'var' and address of 'read_flag' in 'ptr'. After 'wildlings' call, it assigns the address of '_exit' to now point to the 'read_flag' function. I ran the following command
"./GameOfThrones $(python -c 'print("A"*5 + "\x10\xa0\x04\x08\xad\x85\x04\x08"*25 + "A"*5 )')" and flag was "cs628a{db9e5a310244d7bc141b814347d98171}".
