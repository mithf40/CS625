I used an online tool to decompile the binary. I exported the shell code preceded by long sequence of nop sled into an environment variable. I found out the address somewhere in between the nop sled using gdb and it was '0xffffdcec'. After that I found the address of 'putchar' using gdb and it was '0x0804a02c'. So, I exploited format string vulnerability in 'enterName' function to write the address of shellcode into address of putchar. I was able to get the shell in gdb but could not get shell in terminal due to some offset in address of shellcode.
