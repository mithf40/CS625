In this program, function "vuln" has format string vulnerability. In order to get flag, we need to go inside "hello" function. I exploited the format string vulnerability to overwrite the Global Offset Table of "exit" function to point to "hello". I found the address for "exit" in Table using objdump and it was "0x0804a028". I used gbd to find the address of "hello" and it was "0x0804858b". I ran the command
"python -c 'print("BBB\x28\xa0\x04\x08JUNK\x2a\xa0\x04\x08" + "\%08x"*3 + "%34145x" + "%n" + "%33401x" + "%n")' | ./S10rM". It prints out the flag encode using brainfuck. So I used online tool to decode it and the flag was "cs628a{f9bfdff20fc8184b63c796a6a019c3ad}".
