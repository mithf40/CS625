First of all, I decompiled the binary using an online tool to get equivalent C code. After that, I created a file named "password". Then I created a ls.sh file containing command "more flag.txt" in current directory and changed permission of current directory to 777. After that I added the path of current directory in PATH environment variable using "export PATH=~/ctf2/buggy_coder-2:$PATH" command. I gave 10 as input for no. of bytes to read and 1969423767 (=0x75630597) as next input. The program outputted the flag "cs628a{b17f08201bfc102ee6919116c2956651}".
