On running the program using gdb, I figured out that random number generated is 184828608 (=0xb0442c0). Further I noticed that inside "file_size_utility", it call system with its argument being "du -h '%s' 2> /dev/null'", where %s is the placeholder for filename which it asked earlier. To, exploit this vulerability, first I chmod 777 the current directory and gave input of file name as "flag.txt';bash'". It first prints the size of flag.txt in human-readable format and then it brings bash shell. On bash shell I gave command "more flag.txt" and it prints the flag. The flag is "cs628a{a33be261da96e7bdf8d9f76edc0e0bd1}".
