First of all, I disassembled the main. From its disassembly, I noticed that twice of input is stored in register edx and input is shifted left by 3 bits.
Then it is added with edx. So, input becomes 10 times. It then checks if 10 times input equals 4. 
One such input is 429496730. Integer overflow happens and its 10 times is 4.
