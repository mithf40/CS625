After checking the disassembly of main, I found that it allocates 0x101 bytes before scanf call.
So, size of variable must be 0x101 bytes. After scanf it checks if value at 0x101-0xc which is 245 is zero or not.
If it is not zero, it prints the flag.
So, I gave the command `python -c 'print("A"*246)' | ./buggy` and it outputs the flag.
