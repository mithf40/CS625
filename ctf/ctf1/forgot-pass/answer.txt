I executed the program using gdb and put a breakpoint just before it checks if the password is correct.
After that I executed it line by line. I noticed that it matches the password with some hard coded string "ryPugzwCbIEbjBdO"
and that string is its correct password.
After finding the password, I executed the program and found the flag.
